# MetaStatus - A MetaMask-Only Status Update Platform

MetaStatus is a decentralized application (dApp) that offers a simple yet powerful social experience. It allows users to register and authenticate exclusively via MetaMask, post status updates, and view updates from other users on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

- **MetaMask Authentication**: Secure sign-in that ensures only the owner of an Ethereum address can post and interact with statuses.
- **Status Updates**: Users can post their thoughts, updates, and any text content tied to their Ethereum address.
- **Browse Updates**: Scroll through a feed of status updates posted by other users on the platform.
- **Ethereum Integration**: All statuses are transactions and are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and immutability.

## Quick Start

To get started with MetaStatus, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0 or higher)
- npm (v6.0 or higher)
- MetaMask extension installed in your browser
- A little ETH in your MetaMask wallet for gas fees (if interacting with the mainnet)

### Installation
